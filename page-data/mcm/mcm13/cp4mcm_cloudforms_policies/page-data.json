Azure, OpenStack), VMs (vSphere)\n- **Container Project**: managing OpenShift v3 namespaces\n- **Container Node**: managing OpenShift v3 nodes\n- **Container Image**: managing OpenShift v3 container images\n- **Replicator**: managing OpenShift v3 workload such as statefulset, daemonset, deployment, deploymentconfig, replicaset\n- **Pod**: managing OpenShift v3 pods\n\n<ul>\n</ul>\n\n## Using Policies\n\nThe following are some screen shots on defining policy.\n\n1. From the main menu go to **Control** > **Explorer**.\n![Policy control](/assets/img/cp4mcm/cf5_01_explorer.png)\n2. Expand the menu **Policies** > **Policy** > **Control Policy** or **Compliance Policy** > policy type.\n![Policy tree](/assets/img/cp4mcm/cf5_02_tree.png)\n3. Select the policy type that you want to create and then select **Configuration** > **Add new ... Policy**\n![New policy](/assets/img/cp4mcm/cf5_03_addpolicy.png)\n4. Specify the scope condition(s) - based on fields, counts or tags; click **Commit** and click **Add**.\n![Define scope](/assets/img/cp4mcm/cf5_04_scope.png)\n5. Define **Configuration** > **Create a new Condition assigned to this Policy** and specify the conditions.\n![Define condition](/assets/img/cp4mcm/cf5_05_createcondition.png)\nSpecify the condition that you wanted to check, such as number of users more than 5; click **Commit** and click **Add**. <br/>![Add condition](/assets/img/cp4mcm/cf5_05_condition.png)\n6. Select the event (which is the same as the policy name) **Configuration** > **Edit Actions from Policy Event**.\n![Event action](/assets/img/cp4mcm/cf5_06_event.png)\n7. Specify the actions on whether the condition is true or not.
